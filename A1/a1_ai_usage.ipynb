    "It helped me to not only to solve a problemm (even a small one) but also helped me to improve how I write a code and what I should do when I get an error. I actually have never used help() function before as I usually go to stack overflow website to find an answer but AI recommeded first use help() function to get a hint about why I am getting an error and what are the ways I can solve this problem and that was faster and learned a lot of things about the function. The risk is that students who are heavily using AI might be able to submit their assignment but without understanding what they submitted. For me, as I mentioned earlier, because of the suggestion by the AI that I better look at help() function, I was able to find that it has expand = True option and I was able to understand what does it do but when the assignment is getting harder and longer, there is definitely a risk where some people mistakely think that they understood everything and when they actually write it, they realize that they actually did not understand. So even when students get help by AI, they always shold understand what that suggestion mean, where is the difference between what students wrote originally and what AI suggested, and most importantly, they do not make a similar mistake or error next time as much as possible.
