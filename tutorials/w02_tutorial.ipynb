    "1. Download Python 3.13.7: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3137/ (choose \"Windows Installer (64-bit)\")\n",

    "2. Navigate to the folder where you saved the file and double-click on the file to install it.\n",
    "- Before selecting \"Install Now\", make sure you check the box for \"Add python.exe to PATH\".\n",
    "  - NOTE: If you have an older version of Python 3.13 already installed, you may be given the option to \"Upgrade Now\" rather than \"Install Now\".\n",
    "  - NOTE: If you already have Python 3.13.7 installed, the window will say \"Modify Setup\". You can close this window and move on the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, check that Python is installed correctly.\n",
    "- Open the Windows start menu and search for the \"Command Prompt\" program.\n",
    "- Open it, type `python` into the terminal, and press enter. If Python has been installed correctly you should see something like the following:\n",

    "- Verify that the terminal output begins with \"Python 3.13.7\". You can then close this window.\n",
    "  - If the wrong version of Python is displayed, you likely have a conflicting version of Python already installed on this computer. To fix this, you can either uninstall this version of Python (easier option) or force windows to default to the newly downloaded Python 3.13.7 (harder option).\n",

    "  - Add to PATH (requires shell restart)\n",

    "## Task 3: Install Python data science libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of Python's usefulness comes from the vast array of external libraries that extend its functionality to diverse use cases. `pip` is a program which is used to install libraries/packages from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/). We will install libraries for completing data science tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the terminal in VS Code. This can be done by clicking on the `Terminal` tab in the top menu bar and then clicking `New Terminal`. Your terminal should look similar to the below and will be followed by a prompt (e.g., > or $):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/empty_terminal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure the terminal finds the correct version of Python. As you did before:\n",
    "- for Windows, enter `python` into the terminal\n",
    "- for MacOS, enter `python3` into the terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "This should start the Python interactive shell. Check that the correct of Python version (3.13.7) is displayed, then enter `quit()` to exit the interactive shell. If it is not the correct version, or the interactive shell is not started (on Windows the Microsoft store may open up), try restarting you computer and trying again.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now it is time to install our libraries. First we will install the `ipykernel` library, which lets Python be executed in Jupyter notebooks. Type `pip install ipykernel` into the terminal and hit enter/return.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, install some data science libraries by entering the following commands into the terminal (one at a time):\n",
    "- `pip install pandas==2.3.3`\n",
    "- `pip install numpy==2.3.0`\n",
    "- `pip install matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "During the course, you will need to install other libraries using `pip`."

    "## Task 4: Create and run a Python program within VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to actually create and run a Python program in VS Code. This will also help you practice navigating between folders both on the terminal and in VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `EXPLORER` on the side-bar of VS Code lets us navigate files in VS Code, but right now we havn't selected a base folder, so there are none. You can open a new folder by choosing the `Open Folder` button seen in the image below or by clicking on the `File` menu and then on `Open Folder...`. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/open_folder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage you to create a folder to store all of your files for this course. When you open VS Code, you should open this folder so you see all the course files in the Explorer.\n",
    " \n",
    "- If you have not yet created a folder for this course: in the pop-up window, select a location for your course folder, click `New folder` and enter `CSC271` into the text box. Make sure your newly created folder is selected then click `Select Folder`. \n",
    "- If you want to use a folder you have already created for this course: in the pop-up window, navigate to the folder and click `Select Folder` (just remember that in the future that when we refer to the `CSC271` folder that your base folder might be named differently).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We now want create a simple Python script.\n",
    "- First, create a new folder which will hold our Python script. Next to `CSC271` in the Explorer, click the \"New Folder\" button, or right click and select `New Folder`. Name this new folder `tutorials`. When working on different tutorials and assignments in the future you can add new folders to put your work in.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, create a new file in the `tutorials` folder called `w02_tutorial.py`. In the Explorer, select the `tutorials` folder then right click and choose `New File`. Your Explorer view should now look similar to the below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "    CSC271\n",
    "      > tutorials\n",
    "          w02_tutorial.py\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In your `w02_tutorial.py` file, write the following code, but replace `FIRSTNAME` nad `LASTNAME` with your first and last names:\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "    person = pd.Series({'First': 'FIRSTNAME', 'Last': 'LASTNAME'})\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(f'Hello from {person['First']} {person['Last']}')\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now, run your Python script from the terminal. As you did in Task 3, open the terminal. To run your script, you need to give Python a path to its location, but how to do that depends on the terminal's current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, our terminal's current directory should be the `CSC271` folder we selected earlier. If you are ever not sure what the current directory of your terminal is, enter the command `pwd` into the terminal, and the full path of your current directory will be displayed. Try running `pwd` now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the command `ls` to see the contents of the `CSC271` folder. You should see the `tutorials` folder. To see the contents of that folder, type `ls tutorials`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since your script is in the `tutorials` folder, run the program by entering:\n",
    "- for Windows, `python tutorials\\w02_tutorial.py`\n",
    "- for MacOS, `python3 tutorials/w02_tutorial.py`\n",
    "  \n",
    "Alternatively, we can first navigate to the program's folder and then run the script from there. Type `cd tutorials` to change to the `tutorials` directory, then run your program by entering:\n",
    "- for Windows, `python w02_tutorial.py`\n",
    "- for MacOS, `python3 w02_tutorial.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily change the current directory back to the `CSC271` folder. To do this, enter `cd ..` This tells the terminal to go up one level in the file directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Let's also try running Python in an interactive window. This is useful for debugging and inspecting new code.\n",
    "- In the top right corner of VS Code, click the down arrow next to the play button and then click the option highlighted below. This should open an interactive Python window where your code has been run.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/run_as_interactive.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "- To run more code in the window, enter it in the cell at the bottom of the interactive window. Before doing this, you may be prompted to select a \"kernel\" to run the code with. Choose your newly installed Python version as the kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Variables created/changed by running our program or another cell are remembered, and can be called upon in later cells. Try entering the python code `first = person['First']`.\n"
